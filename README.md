# dark-theme-for-elixir-guides

This is a little tweak to apply some sort of dark theme over the Elixir guides website.

The CSS file is hosted in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure but I also have added it here for your convenience.

As you probably know, you will have to apply the theme by copying and pasting the provided JavaScript source code into the Developer Console (Ctrl + Shift + I).

And this is how it looks like.

Of course one downside is that You'll have to do it page by page, the good thing is that since most topics deserves a couple of hours of reading and reflexion you'll be fine.

I've heard this [extension](https://github.com/quoid/userscripts) will let you apply this theme to all pages but I haven't tested it.

Cool.
